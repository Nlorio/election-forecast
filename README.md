Project repository for Data-X, Fall 2018

Rough setup information (WIP) [here](notebooks/0-setup).

API keys are stored in `config.yaml`, which is withheld from the git repository via the [.gitignore](./.gitignore). To reproduce notebooks, create a `config.yaml` in the root project directory and store API keys as the notebook structure suggests.
